About minecraft 1.12.2
- I'm looking for help in preserving the minecraft 1.12.2 legacy (I'm having serious problems with the compatibility of gradle versions and understanding the       documentation (which seems outdated on the "Forge mod Loader" site itself))
- I'd like to save and preserve the legacy of the version with the most complex and well-performing mods that I know of. However, I don't really know how to work   in depth learning to modify (which I'm aware has become EXTREMELY LEGACY, but it works so well ; - .)
- I was able to compile a very simple mod using the MCreator 2021 environment, however the 1.12.2 object generator of this version is not complete. There are no   tutorials or many instructions on how to learn from scratch to work with this tool in this version.
- Help me keep this last legacy version alive and preserved :)
